# acai-ahk-scripts

My ahk scripts that I use daily, including rotating dual monitor, shortcut for wsl

## Features

- map `capslock` to:
  - `escape` when pressed
  - `ctrl` when holding it while pressing other keys
  - `delete` when using `ctrl+capslock`
  - `capslock` when using `alt+capslock`
  - `alt+F4` when using `win+capslock`
- use `win+escape` to stop this ahk script
- `ctrl+alt+r` to rotate the second monitor in windows (open setting and tab to it)
- use `ctrl+alt+t` to open wsl in `~/repo` directory in wsl
- map `alt+hijk` to directions
- map right alt to:
  - to `backspace` when pressed
  - to `enter` when pressing both `left alt` and `right alt`
